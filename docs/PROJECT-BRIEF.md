2. **Face Gallery Operations**

    - Create face galleries for departments/locations
    - List available face galleries
    - Delete face galleries when needed

3. **Employee Face Management**

    - Enroll employee faces with Base64 image encoding
    - List enrolled faces per gallery
    - Verify employee faces for attendance
    - Identify faces for attendance recording
    - Delete employee face data

4. **Image Processing**
    - Image comparison for verification
    - Base64 encoding/decoding for API communication
    - Image quality validation

### Security Requirements

#### Data Protection

- Secure storage of face recognition data
- Encrypted API token management
- HTTPS enforcement for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization

#### Access Control

- Role-based permissions (Admin, Employee)
- Location-based access restrictions
- API rate limiting implementation
- Audit trail for all system activities

#### Privacy Compliance

- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Employee consent management
- Data retention policies
- Right to deletion implementation
